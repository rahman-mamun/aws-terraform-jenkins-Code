 Integrating Jenkins and Terraform
Integrating Jenkins and Terraform enables automated infrastructure provisioning as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

Jenkins Pipeline Stages:

Build: Build your application using Jenkins.
Test: Run tests to ensure application quality.
Deploy: Use Terraform to provision infrastructure and deploy your application.
Automation:

Whenever code is pushed to the repository, Jenkins triggers the pipeline to automatically build, test, and deploy your application.
